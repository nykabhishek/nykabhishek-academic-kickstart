  Hi! Welcome to my webpage. 

  I am Abhishek Nayak, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M University, where I work as a Graduate Research Assistant with the [Autonomous Systems Laboratory](https://autonomy.engr.tamu.edu/). My research explores 'Planning and Vision-based methods for Autonomous Vehicles.' I am an advocate of safe transportation and am currently working with the Texas A&M Transportation Institute on [SAFE-D](https://safed.vtti.vt.edu/) projects that aim at improving standards of road safety. Previously, for my Master's research, I worked on developing vision-based safe response protocols for autonomous vehicles towards emergency response vehicles.

  My research interests broadly include - 1) Perception Models for Mobile Robots, 2) Heuristics and Optimization for Task Allocation and Motion Planning, and 3) Learning-based methods for constrained Motion Planning. During my time at Texas A&M, I was able to explore these topics (and beyond) in-depth and gain practical knowledge by applying my research for field-experiments on an autonomous Lincoln MKZ vehicle [(a teaser)](https://youtu.be/gh0g5iAuruw). I am also an experienced industry professional and have worked in the automotive industry for three years as an R&D Engineer in the powertrains section of [TVS Motor Company, India](https://www.tvsmotor.com/).

  Besides academics, I enjoy playing tennis, running, cooking, and traveling.

  <!-- I work on developing solutions for sensing and planning problems in autonomous vehicles and smart infrastructures.  -->
  
  <!-- I've also been associated with the CAST group at Texas A&M working with Dr. Swaminathan Gopalswamy  -->
