  Hi! Welcome to my webpage. 

  I’m Abhishek Nayak, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M University, College Station. My research interests include developing path-planning and vehicle routing algorithms, robotic perception, computer vision, sensor fusion, and learning-based approaches for problem-solving. I’m passionate about safe transportation and am currently working with the Texas A&M Transportation Institute on [SAFE-D](https://safed.vtti.vt.edu/) projects that aim at improving road safety standards.

  I’ve been part of the Autonomous Systems Laboratory at Texas A&M University, working with Dr. Sivakumar Rathinam since Fall 2017. I received my Master of Science degree in Dec 2019. My thesis work was on developing a vision-based response of autonomous vehicles towards emergency vehicles using infrastructure-enabled autonomy. I also have extensive experience working in the automotive industry before joining Texas A&M. I was working as a Design Engineer at the R&D of TVS Motor Company, India, where I was responsible for the design and development of cylinder-head and valve train parts.

  In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis, soccer, cooking, hiking and traveling.

  <!-- I work on developing solutions for sensing and planning problems in autonomous vehicles and smart infrastructures.  -->
  
  <!-- I've also been associated with the CAST group at Texas A&M working with Dr. Swaminathan Gopalswamy  -->
