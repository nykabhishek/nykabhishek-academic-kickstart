  Hi! Welcome to my webpage. 

  I am Abhishek Nayak, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M University, where I work as a Graduate Research Assistant in the [Autonomous Systems Laboratory](https://autonomy.engr.tamu.edu/). My research explores 'Planning and Vision-based methods for Autonomous Vehicles.' I am passionate about safe transportation and am currently working with the Texas A&M Transportation Institute on [SAFE-D](https://safed.vtti.vt.edu/) projects that aim to improve road safety standards. Previously, for my Master's research, I worked on developing vision-based safe response protocols for autonomous vehicles towards emergency response vehicles.

  My research interests broadly include - 1) Heuristics and Learning-based methods for Motion planning, 2) Perception of autonomous agents, and 3) Distributed autonomy using Infrastructure. During my time at Texas A&M, I explored these topics (and beyond) in-depth and gained practical knowledge by applying my research for field experiments on an autonomous Lincoln MKZ vehicle. I have spent some time in the automotive industry, working for [TVS Motor Company, India](https://www.tvsmotor.com/) for three years as an R&D Engineer in their powertrains section.

  Besides academics, I enjoy playing tennis, running, cooking, and traveling.
