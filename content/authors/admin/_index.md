  Hi! Welcome to my webpage. 

  Iâ€™m Abhishek Nayak, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M University, College Station. My research interests include perception and motion planning for Robots. I am passionate about safe transportation and am currently working with the Texas A&M Transportation Institute on [SAFE-D](https://safed.vtti.vt.edu/) projects that aim at improving road safety standards.

 I have been part of the Autonomous Systems Laboratory at Texas A&M University, working with Dr. Sivakumar Rathinam since Fall 2017.  I have extensive hands-on experience implementing robotic perception, computer vision, sensor fusion, SLAM, and developing heuristics and learning-based algorithms for motion planning of indoor and outdoor autonomous vehicles. 

  I am an experienced industry professional and have worked in the automotive industry for three years as a Design Engineer at the R&D of TVS Motor Company, India, where I was responsible for powertrain design and development.

  I enjoy playing tennis, running, soccer, cooking, and traveling.

  <!-- I work on developing solutions for sensing and planning problems in autonomous vehicles and smart infrastructures.  -->
  
  <!-- I've also been associated with the CAST group at Texas A&M working with Dr. Swaminathan Gopalswamy  -->
