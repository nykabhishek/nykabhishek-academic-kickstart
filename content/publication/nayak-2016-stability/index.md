abstract: "During cornering of a two wheeler under dynamic conditions when the vehicle is steered to the left or right, the axis of the wheels and other rotating parts undergoes precession along with spinning which produces a gyroscopic couple. Due to the action of these moments on the vehicles along with the centrifugal forces and gravity acting on it, the vehicle may either skid or overturn depending on the angle of tilt, velocity of the motorcycle, radius of the curve & mass of the vehicle. The main objective of this work is to ensure the safe negotiation of the turn and to prevent accidents by establishing a harmonious relationship between the effecting parameters. A device was developed to act as a feedback control system; taking the inputs from a IMU sensor, predict the equilibrium conditions and thereby control the dynamic parameters of the 2 wheeler in order to enable it negotiate the curve safely."
