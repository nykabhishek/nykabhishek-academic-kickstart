title: Heuristics and Reinforcement learning models for curvature constrained vehicle routing problems
summary: As a part of this work I developed heuristics, and exact methods to obtain fast feasible solutions for the Dubins mTSP problem. I also explored learning based approached to solve this problem and Trained reinforcement learning (RL) models, recurrent neural networks (RNNâ€™s), LSTM networks, and Encoder-Decoder neural networks for graph networks using PyTorch. The results obtained were compared against the solutions from Mixed-Integer programs (MIP) formulations that were solved using CPLEX and Gurobi solvers on high-performance computing servers.
