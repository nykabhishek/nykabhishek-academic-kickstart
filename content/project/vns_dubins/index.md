title: Heuristics and Reinforcement learning models for curvature constrained vehicle routing problems
summary: As a part of this work, I developed heuristics, Mixed-Integer programs (MIP), trained neural networks, and reinforcement learning (RL) models to solve curvature-constrained multi-vehicle routing problems. The reinforcement learning (RL) models and recurrent neural networks (RNNâ€™s) for graphs were implemented and trained using PyTorch. The Mixed-Integer programs (MIP) formulations were solved using CPLEX solvers on high-performance computing servers.
