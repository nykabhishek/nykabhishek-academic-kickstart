title: Multi-Agent SLAM and navigation using ROSBot
summary: Used ROSBot by Husarion to implement multi-agent SLAM algorithms to obtain occupancy grid maps using multiple car-like robots. These robots were also used as a demonstration platform to showcase the path planning / vehicle routing algorithms I developed as part of my PhD thesis on "Planning and Vision-based tools for Autonomous Vehicles"
