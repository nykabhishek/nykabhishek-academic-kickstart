title: Multi-Agent SLAM and navigation using ROSBot
summary: In this project, I implemented multi-agent SLAM to build occupancy grid maps using ROSBots 2.0 by Husarion. These robots were also used as a demonstration platform to showcase the motion planning algorithms I developed as part of my PhD thesis on "Planning and Vision-based tools for Autonomous Vehicles"
