title: Response of Autonomous Vehicles to Emergency Response Vehicles (RAVEV)
summary: The objective of this project was to explore how an autonomous vehicle must safely respond to different classes of emergency vehicles using sound, vision and other onboard sensors. I developed vision-based emergency vehicle detection, tracking and localization capabilities for the smart road-side infrastructure using Python and ROS. YOLO-v3 was used as the base architecture for object detection, and a TensorFlow-based object classification neural network was developed using Keras.

    <h4>Abstract:</h4>
    The objective of this project is to explore an ideal response action of an autonomous vehicle towards response vehicles in emergency scenarios using vision, sound and other sensors. I developed vision-based algorithms to reliably detect and track emergency vehicles from a video feed using image processing, machine learning, deep neural networks and other computer vison techniques.
